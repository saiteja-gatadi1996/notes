### Redux Toolkit

##### 1) Why Redux over Context API ?
i) When it comes to bigger applications, especially if they're built by a team of developers, One of the biggest challenges is state management.

ii) Yes, context API is very useful tool, but it clearly has its limits, especially when we talk about big applications with tons of features and that is why we use the most popular library called Redux.

iii) Well Redux is not part of official react even though they are used together.


##### 2) Why Redux ToolKit over Redux ?

i) Even though Redux solves a lot of problems, it also introduces some new headaches. In short, it requires bunch of annoying boilerplate and manual setup, especially when it comes to advanced features. Since you'll need to install more libraries and add some more config setup, which over time, especially if you have to do it for every project, just becomes annoying.

And this is where Redux Toolkit comes into play.......

##### 3) What Redux Toolkit is doing special ?

i) So creators of Redux notice the general need for opinionated approach while setting up Redux applications, and as a result, they came up with Redux Toolkit, which effectively is Redux with batteries.

ii) Basically, it means that all the popular extra libraries and setups are built in and do not require extra setup. As a result, there is no time consuming set up and over time it speeds up our workflow tremendously.

iii) So with Redux Toolkit, we get all of the benefits.
